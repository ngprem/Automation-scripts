README: 🧠 Memory Critical Alert Automation for Windows Servers

📖 Overview  
->Automates monitoring of physical memory usage on Windows servers in Azure. 
->The script checks if memory usage exceeds a threshold (default 80%) and sends alert emails. 
->If memory usage is normal, it resolves the incident and attaches a snapshot of memory usage.

✨ Features  
- ✅ Ping server to verify availability  
- 💽 Query physical memory usage remotely  
- ⚠️ Send alert emails if memory usage is critical  
- 📩 Send resolution email with memory snapshot if usage is normal  
- 🔐 Requires jump box credentials for secure access
